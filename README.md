# nur-packages

These are my personal nix packages, overlays, modules and functions which I chose to share with the community in hope of providing value to others :)

Some of them are only useful to me and a handful of people, others are in the process of being tested by myself and others before starting a pull request for nixpkgs.

This repository is inspired by and a part of [NUR](https://github.com/nix-community/NUR), the Nix User Repository - instructions on how to use it are available on their project site.

## Contents

### Functions
`aes-cbc` can decrypt a string at evaluation time. This allows to push nix configurations with secrets to a public git. Note: The decrypted string will be stored in cleartext in the `/nix/store`!

### Modules
`cpupower` can automatically turn the frequency governor to `performance` when plugged into power and back to `powersave` when unplugged again.

`ip-to-usb` allows you to configure a headless host to write its IP-address configuration to a USB drive on plugging it in for a few seconds.
Optionally the USB drive is required to provide authentication.
